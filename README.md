# Toto backup

Simple tool to back up your Yoto cards.

## Usage

- Read your Yoto card and copy the associated URL (it should look like `https://yoto.io/XXXXX?ABCDEFGHIJKL=MNOPQRSTUVWXY`).
  You can download an NFC reader application on your smartphone to do that:
  - Android: [NFC Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc)
  - iOS: [NFC Tools](https://apps.apple.com/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749)
- Download the latest `toto-backup.pyz` version from https://github.com/ldesgrange/toto-backup/releases.
- In a terminal, run: `python toto-backup.pyz URL` where `URL` is replaced with the URL present on your Yoto card.
  That will create a folder with the tracks, icons and cover art in it.
